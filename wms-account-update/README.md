To use:

Prior to doing anything, edit the script to change the JSON record to include any changes you want to make (e.g. adding a network ID). 

Run the python script. It will give you a URL to click on. Open the link in a browser and authorize. In the resulting Ill error message screen, copy and past the auth code from the URL and go back to the script to paste it in. When prompted for the user id, it is in the Diagnostics section of the WMS record.

The first user ID prompt should give you a JSON record to show you that the right record was found. Enter the user ID a second time to repeat the call, this time as a put which will upload the modified JSON record.
